      <p>Oleg D. Jefimenko is a physicist. He was born on October 14, 1922 in Kharkiv, Ukraine and he was died on May 14, 2009 in Morgantown, West Virginia, US.</p>

        <p>He received his B.A. degree at Lewis and Clark College in 1952 and his M. A. degree at the University of Oregon in 1954. He received his Ph.D. degree at the University of Oregon in 1956. Jefimenko worked for the development of the theory of electromagnetic retardation and relativity.</p>

        <p>In 1956, he was awarded the Sigma Xi Prize. In 1971 and 1973, he won awards in the AAPT Apparatus Competition.</p>
